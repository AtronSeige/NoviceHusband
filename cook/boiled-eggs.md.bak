Here are Tanjaâ€™s instructions on how she boils eggs.

The soft eggs have a runny yolk and are very difficult to peel. These are best enjoyed from the shell.

The hard eggs are easier to peel, and the yolk is not runny, but it is soft. I peel these easily, but doing many small cracks, so that the shell is completely broken, then pealing it all in one go.

# Instructions 

1. NOTE: Eggs must be room temperature
2. Bring a pot of water to a boil
3. Prep a bowl of ice water (you can also keep the eggs under cold running water if you're low on ice - just uses more water, and takes a bit longer to cool down)
4. Pierce the top of the egg with a needle (the blunt end of the egg)

## For hard boiled eggs
Add the eggs to the boiling water with a spatula and boil for 8 minutes.

## For soft boiled eggs
Add the eggs to the boiling water with a spatula and boil for 6 minutes.

5. Remove from the water with a spatula and place into the ice water

## To do both type at the same time
If you want to make both at the same time (I just mark the eggs with a permanent marker to know which is which)

1. Add the eggs to be hard boiled to the boiling water, and boil for 2 minutes
1. Add the eggs to be soft boiled to the water with the hard-boiled eggs, and boil for 6 minutes
1. Remove from the water with a spatula and place into the ice water
